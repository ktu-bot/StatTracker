# StatTracker

This application was made to help keep track of the stats during a volleyball game. Used as a coaching tool, this freed up an extra assistant coach with me and 
allowed for more focus on the actual gameplay. This application helped saved an estimated 30 minutes per game, (from setting up the 
stat sheets pre game, analyzing it post game, and asking for replay confirmation during the actual gameplay) and aided in our team 
winning 6 tournaments and placed top 10 in the province.
